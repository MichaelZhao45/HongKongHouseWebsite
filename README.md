<h1> Restart - January 20, 2024 </h1>
I am getting back to this project.  The project is a website for my parent's business.
Goals for this project...

- Menu Page, displaying prices of different food items
- Gallery Page, different pictures of the restaurant and food items
- Contact Page, contact information and the location of the business
- Home Page, interactive image slider, going through different images of the business + special dishes, chef specials + all information that should be quick and easy for users + reviews section

I should make a time goal for this website.  For now, let's say by the end of Spring Reading Week (Feb 25, 2024).  A little hopeful as I have a project-based course that needs my attention but we stay grinding.
Will have to learn Java Script as well, I know a little but not enough for this. 

<h1> Update - Feb 23, 2024 </h1>
Well, we're back at it again.  I'm currently working on the contact section while waiting for a banner and logo to be made by a designer. 

As for items that I have done...
- Slideshow to display images
- Navigation Bar 
- Banner placement and dimensions

Just a short update, will be keeping a log of my activities in this README to look back if I need to.  Will probably not update this every single time I work on this project, only when I've hit a major milestone.
