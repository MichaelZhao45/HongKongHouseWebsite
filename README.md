<h1> Restart - January 20, 2024 </h1>
I am getting back to this project.  The project is a website for my parent's business.
Goals for this project...

- Menu Page, displaying prices of different food items
- Gallery Page, different pictures of the restaurant and food items
- Contact Page, contact information and the location of the business
- Home Page, interactive image slider, going through different images of the business + special dishes, chef specials + all information that should be quick and easy for users + reviews section

I should make a time goal for this website.  For now, let's say by the end of Spring Reading Week (Feb 25, 2024).  A little hopeful as I have a project-based course that needs my attention but we stay grinding.
Will have to learn Java Script as well, I know a little but not enough for this.
